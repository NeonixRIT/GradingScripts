# GradingScripts
Welcome to the GradingScripts, home of all the scripts needed to grade the class GCIS-123/124!

Here is a brief guide for how to use the grading scripts for GCIS-123/124. In this quick guide, I’ll be going over how to use these scripts, each of there purposes, and how to use them for the first time. If you’re not a CA for GCIS-123/124, please stop reading. Or don’t. Not like this will be a very entertaining read.

# Prerequisites
 - Python 3.10 or newer
 - Git 2.30.0 or newer

 NOTE: Required Python modules are installed at script start.
  - versionmanager.py: Check remote repo for updated release
  - PyGithub: Library to interact with GitHub API

Before we get started with other things, let’s make sure you have installed what you need to actually run the scripts.

If you don't have Python installed already, lets get that installed. Head to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version, make sure to check the `Add Python 3.X to PATH` button if you're on Windows.

## How to get Github O-Auth token
Now that you have the package installed you can now run the scripts, huzzah! But wait, what’s this information you need? It doesn’t just work? Blasphemy!

Well, that’s what we’re going over next, what you should have access to for grading. We have 2 scripts, each of which does the same thing but can be run differently. Included is also a `./data` folder. This folder contains config.json which will be created after running the script for the first time and is used for storing information that should be consistent across the semester, primarily your Github Authentication token and the Github Organization name.

You’re probably thinking, “What’s a Github Authentication token?”. Basically it’s a token generated by Github that can be used to login to your Github account through the scripts. Needless to say, if you plan on using these scripts, you need to make a token. So let’s go over that now.

|Steps | Guiding Images|
|:-----: | :-----------:||
|Log into your Github account||
|Go to the upper right-hand corner of the screen, click on the icon with your profile picture, and then on the settings. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148611772-d5618152-002c-496c-bcb0-1da258b392c5.png)|
|Click on the “Developer Settings” button at the bottom left. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148611844-2cc60d7c-88db-4f99-9736-2cf8d8a3ae8a.png)|
|Click on the “Personal access tokens” button. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148611927-20330743-23ed-4157-8bae-3aaf248b6275.png)|
|Click on the “Generate new token” icon in the top right of the screen (you may be prompted to log in again upon clicking this). | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148612005-b95ccbdf-ca0a-4726-891e-9c7129b4be5e.png)|
|Add a Note so you know what the token is being used for. You can set it to never expire or add a custom expiration date (NOTE: every time the token expires you will need to update it in `tmp/config.txt`). Make sure to give it the “repo” and “read:packages” permissions. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148612633-8bcf62f2-7238-48bc-9853-ea45024b055f.png)|
|Scroll to the bottom and click the “Generate token” button. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148612852-b67538b2-e267-4d65-8a0d-9c1926fd6cc4.png)|
|Copy this new token and put it somewhere safe (or put it into the script directly). NOTE: This will be stored in a file called `config.txt` in the `tmp` in the same location as the scripts. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148612967-0d27ae1a-8e1f-4d49-b685-f7652fad883c.png)|

Some extra information about these tokens, you won’t be able to see them again after you get out of the page, so paste it in another file, or to where the script prompts you. The script will store it so you only have to do this once. However, if you delete the token on Github, the token will be rejected and you’ll need to delete or edit the config.txt file in order to be able to use them again. The script will give you an error if you use an invalid token.

## Get Organization Name
The next thing you’ll need to do is get the organization name from Github. This is relatively easy compared to making a personal access token. Once you’re added to the organization, you should be able to access it on the left of the Github homepage.

In order to ensure you spell it right, it’s recommended you click on the organization and copy the organization name from the link at the top of your browser, and then enter it into the script when prompted.

## Get Class Roster

Finally we will be getting a classroom roster csv file from Github Classroom in order to make grading easier. This will allow the script to change github usernames to peoples actually names. The script will also only clone the entries in the csv file. This is option of couse but is highly recommended so that you don't have to clone every repo from the organization every time.

|Steps | Guiding Images|
|:-----: | :-----------:||
|Go to https://classroom.github.com/classrooms and login if needed |
|Go to your classroom/organization for the semester | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148614399-e52af804-ea5e-47dc-8468-b94c52117579.png)|
|At the top click on the `Students` tab | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148614455-a2eb28f0-5920-4564-8f64-91d1ef67311f.png)|
|Then under classroom roster, click `download` | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148614534-833eb319-1c4a-49e4-b6d7-960cb3700a27.png)|
|Then click `Download without group names` | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12210881/148614634-e0e64e82-d8e0-4810-a174-dce89e47e549.png)|

And Tada! You now have a CSV file containing all the students for your classroom. I recommend opening the CSV file to delete the entries of students you will not be grading.
I also recommend placing the classroom roster file into the `./data/csvs` folder.

After you enter all the information, the script will clone all the repositories and put them all into the folder specified. Inside will be a folder named after the assignment name and the date/time specified.

## One last thing to note, first time running the script but be done with admin privileges, so start it in an admin powershell/cmd/whatever window. This is to properly install the pip packages required for the script to work.
## Congratulations! You’ve either read or skimmed through my entire guide. May your grading be easy and enjoyable thanks to these scripts!
